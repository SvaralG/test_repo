## Dynamic typing
Dynamic typing  is a technique used in programming languages ​ ​ and specification languages ​ ​ in which a variable is associated with a type at the time the value is assigned, and not at the time the variable is declared. Thus, in different sections of the program, the same variable can take values ​ ​ of different types
